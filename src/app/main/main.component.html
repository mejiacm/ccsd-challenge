  <h1 class="mt-4">SWAPI Challenge</h1>
  Your challenged to build a simple applcations that queries the <a href="https://swapi.co/" target="_blank">SWAPI API</a>. This is a fun API that displays data of the Star Wars movie franchise. Please don't use ay wrapper/library, we want to see your coding skills!<br /><br />
  The challange consists on displaying data on the left menu by querying the following endpoints:<br />
  <pre>
        <code>
            &#123;
                "films": "https://swapi.co/api/films/",
                "people": "https://swapi.co/api/people/",
                "planets": "https://swapi.co/api/planets/",
                "species": "https://swapi.co/api/species/",
                "starships": "https://swapi.co/api/starships/",
                "vehicles": "https://swapi.co/api/vehicles/"
            &#125;
        </code>
  </pre>
For instance, the "Films" route on the left should display data on an HTML table from the <div class="d-inline p-2 bg-primary text-white">https://swapi.co/api/films/</div> endpoint and the result count should be displayed in the <strong>Total Results</strong> green square at the top right corner. You don't have to display all columns, with just a few is enough since we are just trying to assess your ability to work with an API response.<br /><br />
To start please clone this project on <a href="https://stackblitz.com/" target="_blank">StackBlitz</a>, once you are done please send us the link, the team will then meet to check your code. If you have any questions please let us know.<br /><br />
<h2>Bonus Points!</h2>
This is totally optional but you will earn bonus points if you complete any/all of the following:
<ul>
    <li>Secure the application by adding a login component</li>
    <li>Create a <b>NodeJS API</b> for login (we don't use Firebase)</li>
    <li>Link data internally. ie: If you query the "people" endpoint the first results is "Luke Skywalker", on the data returned you can link the "starships" to the route at "https://swapi.co/api/starships/" and filter it displaying only data for the starships 12 & 22 which are related to the pilot.</li>
    <li>Add a search box on any/all the routes to filter data</li>
    <li>Use Boostrap components</li>
    <li>Make the "Toggle Menu" button work</li>
    <li>If you feel like showing off your skills adding some fancy features we would love to see that too!</li>
